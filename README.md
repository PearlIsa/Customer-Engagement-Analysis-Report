# Customer-Engagement-Analysis-Report
The aim is to determine the best time to dial customers to maximize RPC (Right Party Contact) and Success rates, while analyzing the impact of various variables such as Campaign, Segment, Client_Name, Product, Post Code, Balance, Ring, Hour of Call, Date of Call, and Interval.
Key Findings:
- Optimal calling times were identified, with the highest RPC_mean (0.253) and RPC_sum (553) observed at 3:00 PM.
- A moderate positive correlation (0.285) between RPC and Success rates was found.
- Actionable insights included focusing on calling during peak hours (11:00 AM to 3:00 PM) and reducing the number of rings before answering.
